    <p>
      The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible
      activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

    <h1>Characteristics of Banker's Algorithm:</h1>
    <p>
      1. Keep many resources that satisfy the requirement of at least one client.<br />
      2. Whenever a process gets all its resources, it needs to return them in a restricted period.<br />
      3. When a process requests a resource, it needs to wait.<br />
      4. The system has a limited number of resources.<br />
      5. Advance feature for max resource allocation.<br />
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Advantages</h1>
    <p>
      1. It contains various resources that meet the requirements of each process.<br />
      2. Each process should provide information to the operating system for upcoming resource requests, the number of resources, and how long the resources will be held.<br />
      3. It helps the operating system manage and control process requests for each type of resource in the computer system.<br />
      4. The algorithm has a Max resource attribute that represents indicates each process can hold the maximum number of resources in a system.<br />
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
    <p>
      1. It requires a fixed number of processes, and no additional processes can be started in the system while executing the process.<br />
      2. The algorithm does no longer allows the processes to exchange its maximum needs while processing its tasks.<br />
      3. Each process has to know and state their maximum resource requirement in advance for the system.<br />
      4. The number of resource requests can be granted in a finite time, but the time limit for allocating the resources is one year.<br />
